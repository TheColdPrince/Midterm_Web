# Midterm_Web
This repository was created as an examination and contains HTML and CSS that follow the box model concept. It includes properties such as display, position, text-align, and fonts, and is designed to be fully responsive. The website has been optimized for speed.

Additionally, I would like to mention that I have added advanced CSS techniques.
